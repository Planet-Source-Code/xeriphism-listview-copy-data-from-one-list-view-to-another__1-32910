</div>

### Description

ok, it might not be too useful but i needed it. basically it copies the contents of one listview on one form to another listview on another form.
 
### More Info
 
um i'm assuming ur level of understanding is equal or greater than mine, so put up with the stuff that may seem obvious, some of you might find things that others find a little 'too obvious' quite useful. i didn't write this for you advanced programmin hax0rs ;)

yeah read the code... it's commented (i don't know how well as this is my first submissioN!)
